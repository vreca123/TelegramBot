# TelegramBot

This repository features some code written for a [Telegram Bot](https://t.me/best_gamblr_bot) in Python and some code for the Flask server that was paired with the Telegram Bot code. I tried deploying it with Railway but failed on the backend, so the Stripe payments currently don't work, but you can still interact with the bot.

Working on the mini-app that would accompany the Telegram Bot I also ran into some issues on the backend and haven't deployed it yet. Locally it was connected to the Bot and you could interact with the interface, but again you can't make any Stripe payments.
